# Twitter contest bot

This advanced bot searches and parses French contest tweets ("RT + Follow + Like to win"), 
then automatically enters the contest, and waits a set amount of time to go on to the next contest.
Through threading, it simultaneously looks for specific topics to retweet with a comment every
once in a while to give the illusion of a non-bot account.

Uses the Tweepy module.

##### Note: 

I created this bot for training purposes, please do not use it to pollute Twitter with more spam.
